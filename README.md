### Project description

This work analyses the relationship between on-premises liquor licensed locations and crime incidents occurring late at night (10pm-4am), by census tracts in Washington D.C. in 2017. Our main hypothesis was that crime would be positively associated with the presence of on-premises liquor licensed locations.

We restricted our analysis to on-premise liquor licensed locations (which include clubs, nightclubs, taverns, arenas) and crime incidents falling under the categories of simple assault and disorderly conduct (since these are the ones more associated with alcohol intoxication). Our decision to restrict the analysis to the late-night timeframe was based on the hypothesis that on-premises liquor outlets are more crowded at those times, while crime is more prone to occur at night. 

For the analysis purpose, we start with a comprehensive exploratory analysis compound of summary statistics and a point pattern analysis, to end with a spatial auto-correlation model based on Moranâ€™s I statistic.
